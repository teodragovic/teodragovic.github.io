Think I read it last more than 20 years ago. It’s much more kiddie book than I remember. Reads almost like a fairy tale. I kept comparing it to the movies in my head. It has less world-building and the story is mostly focused on Bilbo’s adventures. But it’s very well written and reads easily without being dumbed down. Chapters that went in-depth the most are Trolls adventure, Golumn episode and Beorn’s house. Naturally, those are the parts that stuck with me the most over the years. Battle of five armies took maybe a few pages. Skipped all song-singing.

Anyways, I have some more appreciation for all the good parts movies added in. Still think they could do it in two and without old-ass Legolas. Next up, reading LOTR trilogy.
