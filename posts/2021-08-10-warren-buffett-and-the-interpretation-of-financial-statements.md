Very short and written in a way a 5-year-old could understand. Good for a complete noob as an introduction into financial statements and their role in value investing. I also have a better understanding of Warren Buffet's actual investing approach.

The langauge has a lot of fluff and needless upselling in every chapter which quickly became tiring. And I wish real-world examples extended to more than a few companies like Coca-Cola, Washington Post and GM.
