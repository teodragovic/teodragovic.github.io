On Windows, when doing stuff like `git merge` in terminal, my editor is Vim. On Ubuntu default editor is Nano. This is how to change it:

TL;DR:
```
sudo update-alternatives --config editor
```

Note: entering this command directly in Ubuntu terminal from Windows didnâ€™t work (`update-alternatives` command not found). I had to open VS Code in WSL2 and enter it via integrated terminal.
