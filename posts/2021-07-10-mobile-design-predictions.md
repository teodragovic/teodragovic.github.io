Quoting myself from the comment I left over at [Chris'](https://css-tricks.com/safari-15-new-ui-theme-colors-and-a-css-tricks-cameo/#comment-1773885):

> Last Christmas, my wife got me a new Android phone with 6” display. On it, Android 11 featured Chrome serach bar at the bottom. Firefox for Android also has search bar at the bottom by default (although this can be changed).
>
> I suspect it has something to do with larger screen sizes and top part of the screen not being as acessible on handheld devices (espacially when using single-hand).
>
> If I were to do a design prediction, I would say we should see even more movement from headers toward rich footers in the future.
