Stunning website alert: https://www.bluemarinefoundation.com/the-sea-we-breathe/

I bookmarked it back in 2021 but forgot about it until recently. It still looks impressive. The message and topics explored are very similar to [Ocean with David Attenborough](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33022710/) (but with a less bleak outlook).
