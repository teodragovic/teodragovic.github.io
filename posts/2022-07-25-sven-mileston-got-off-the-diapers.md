Happened while Sven and Maja were in Pirovac for the summer vacation. He started going to the potty around the same time he started kindergarten but not regularly. He would say when he needed to poop but was still peeing in diapers. But every sickness would cause a regression. And there were a lot of those.

As recommended, we waited for summer to make the transition and it went pretty painless. Probably since heâ€™s already 3 and a half years old. We kept night diapers for a short while, but he quickly started to wake up and demand the potty, so we got rid of those. For about a week he pooped more often. It might have been some light flu or his body was just adjusting. He wetted himself maybe a few times since getting back from vacation.
