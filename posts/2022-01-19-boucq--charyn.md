Meh. The drawing is nice enough. Kinda reminds me of Jeremiah by Hermann. The first story I skipped early. The latter two were more captivating but both fell apart towards the end.

Not a fan of magic realism in Charyn's writing. Surreal elements usually come out of nowhere and serve as a clunky instrument to wrap up a story when it seems there are no other directions it can take.
