I wanted my WSL bash to look the same as the one I have on Windows where I use [Git bash for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

Two resources that helped me where [this question and answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62587050/how-do-i-show-up-the-current-branch-in-wsl-i-use-vscode) and [this article with tips about styling bash shell](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/09/bash-shell-ps1-10-examples-to-make-your-linux-prompt-like-angelina-jolie/)

**TL;DR**

1. Add `"terminal.integrated.shellArgs.linux": ["-l"]` in VSCode settings
2. Modify prompt in `~/.bashrc` (the one located in WSL)

```
PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\w\[\033[36m\]$(__git_ps1)\n\[\033[00m\]$ '
```

This is my final modification that gives me green working dir and cyan branch name and a white caret on a new line.
