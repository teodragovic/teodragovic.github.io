Living on the hill makes my delivery options limited and usually expensive. Wolt is not even an option. Direct delivery sometimes exists, but they often complain or won’t come if the order is small. Glovo is usually my only option, and these are the three best choices for delivery:

- Large chimichanga de Pollo from [Mrak grill](https://www.facebook.com/MrakZagreb/)
- Mađarski popečci from [Fešta Gušti](https://restoran-festa-zagreb.com/naslovnica/)
- Any kind of chicken noodles from [Wok San Michele](https://www.instagram.com/woksanmichele/)

These orders continuously provide the most satisfying meals. Note to self: don’t experiment or spend too much time looking around and stick to the basics.
