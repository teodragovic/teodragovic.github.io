TL;DR: `<Component(\s|\n)[^>]*?property`

When Iâ€™m refactoring Preact code, I often find myself searching all places where some component is used with a certain prop (ie. all buttons with a `primary` prop). Thankfully, VS Code supports passing regex as search query. This little snippet I [lifted from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56522349) does exactly what it says.
