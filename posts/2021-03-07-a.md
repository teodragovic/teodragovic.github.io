Buy butternut squash. Cut it into slices. Clean seeds with a spoon. Cut slices so they look like fries. Season with a mix of salt, pepper and red paprika (or Mexican mix). Spread on the baking sheet and put in the oven at 180 Â°C for as long as needed to become soft (usually 30-45 min.). Goes great with red meat.
