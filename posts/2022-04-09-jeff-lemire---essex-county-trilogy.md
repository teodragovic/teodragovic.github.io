Picked it up on a whim, totally random. The first story was mediocre. Neither drawing nor story captured my interest. The second story had more meat to it and was an improvement. Slowly pulling common thread between Lebauf family kept me engaged enough to finish it.

Third story nicely wraps everything up, tying different timelines together. Drawing and pacing improved noticeably between parts one and three. Two shorts are ok, nothing special. Overall, don’t see award-winning qualities here, but it did have something that moved me to check other works from the author.

## Invisible man

Lemire’s 3-part comic. Drawn in the same style as Essex but also uses blue for accent. Less emotional and more straightforward. Solid little SF story.
