Not a big drinker. I don’t like the taste and I only drink with the purpose to get drunk. But when it comes to it, these are my picks:

- **Spritzer** - white wine mixed with water. In Croatia, it’s called gemišt when using soda and bevanda when using regular water. I prefer bevanda since I get less gassed but gemišt is fine, especially if the wine is stronger. For wine selection, I like Graševina from Belje.

- **Cider** - only "beer" I like. It’s more like soda with alcohol in it. Strongbow and Somersby are good.

- **Mead (medica)** - honey-based liqueur. The closest thing to hard drink I can stand. Shoutout to any kind of super sweet, candy-colored liqueurs used for cooking.
