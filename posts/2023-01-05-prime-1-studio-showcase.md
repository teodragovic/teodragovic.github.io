I thought McFarlane Toys were detailed, but Prime 1 is next level. Some of the pieces here are amazing. The very first Batman is my favorite. Looking at other videos on the channel, I realize there is a whole industry revolving around high-detail collectibles from every franchise imaginable.

Bonus: Sculpting Willem Dafoe as the Joker
