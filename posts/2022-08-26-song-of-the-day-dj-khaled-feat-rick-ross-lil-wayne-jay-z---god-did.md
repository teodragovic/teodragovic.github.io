A monster. Hov killed it. It would have been even stronger if he didn’t jump on it incognito and instead had Wayne or Ross come with a longer, better verse. But I don’t mind it like it is now. At +8 minutes and without many variations in the beat still doesn’t get tedious. Had it on repeat for hours. Motivational music at its finest.
