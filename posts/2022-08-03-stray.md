Just finished Stray. Fantastic video game. Very nice graphics with a high amount of small details spread around. The atmosphere was super immersive. The main character (aka the Cat) is adorable and a joy to play with. Movements and behavior are so detailed I wanted to leave cat food next to my PC.

Easy puzzles and straightforward platforming (ie. jumping available only in certain spots) were very welcoming for a casual gamer like me. Action sequences with Zurgs and Santinels were my least favorite but werenâ€™t too distracting or difficult.

The story is simple but charming, especially the design of Companions. The last scene with B-12 and the Cat was a real tearjerker.

The animation of the roof opening over the walled city was very satisfying. Stray is the closes one can get to visiting [Kowloon](/blog/kowloon-walled-city/). I wish there were some kind of free roam mode available after finishing the main story.

If there were more games like Stray or [Firewatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWtTsFypKM4) I would probably indulge gaming more often.
