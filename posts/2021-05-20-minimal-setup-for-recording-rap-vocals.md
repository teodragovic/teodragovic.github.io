| Equipment          | My setup                |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Laptop             | MacBook Air 2016.       |
| USB soundcard      | Focusrite Scarlett Solo |
| Dynamic microphone | Shure SM58              |
| Cable              | XLR cable               |
| Mic stand          | Hercules mic stand      |
| Headphones         | Sennheiser HD 25-1      |
| Pop filter         | OSS ASVS6-GB            |

Notes:
- this setup assumes home recording without soundbooth or any kind of room treatment
- before MacBook, I used Lenovo G710 so pretty much any modern laptop will do
- jack adapter might be needed, depending on headphones and soundcard inputs/outputs
- if not standing and for studio mobility, desk tripod stand would do
- before buying pop blocker I used foam windscreen (also better for mobility)
