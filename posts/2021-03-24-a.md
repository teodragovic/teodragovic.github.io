Sven went to the potty for the first time today. Sadly, I wasnâ€™t there to witness it but apparently, our nanny noticed he wanted to go so she put him on a potty before he managed to do it in a diaper. We bought potty 1-2 months ago but so far he only used it as a step to reach high places and showed no interest in ditching diapers except being mildly agitated at times after peeing.
