## Captain America: Civil War

It's like Liquid Swords. Solo joint but everybody is there. Airport fight scene FTW.

## Thor: Ragnarok

Super fun. Heavy on the slapstick jokes. Everything is over the top without taking anything too serious.

## Avengers: Infinity War

Easily the best and most balanced one. Having all A-list stars bring their A-game here probably helps. Also, parallel storylines help with dynamics and not making it dull. This was the first time, in both movies and comics, where the whole "bunch of superheroes" thing finally made sense to me.

Honorable mentions: The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy
