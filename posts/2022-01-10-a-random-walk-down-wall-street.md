This one took a while. Felt like going through a school textbookâ€”the best book on investing so far.

"Intelligent investor" had an excellent bottom line, but big chunks were outdated or irrelevant for non-US citizens. Malkiel has pretty much the same message but explains it much better.

Now I feel I have a pretty good understanding and the idea of where I want to go with my investments (but still plan to read Peter Lynch next). Random walk covered almost every lingering question I had.

I wish I had a phisical edition in English. Croatian translation was horrid and going through ebook would probably take even longer.
