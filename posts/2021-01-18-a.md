Getting Windows update while in Windows Insider Program leaves an ugly watermark in the lower right corner.

To remove it use [Universal Watermark Disabler](https://winaero.com/download-universal-watermark-disabler/).

The program throws warning about the untested build but it still works.
After every new build update watermark gets restored so the program needs to be run again.

Note to self: search for uwd.exe on D: drive.
