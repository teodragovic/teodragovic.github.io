Something I learned from [Kitty](https://kittygiraudel.com/2020/02/03/lessons-from-building-n26-for-web/):

> I have recently been taught the word “sonder”. That is the realisation that everyone, including passers-by, has a life as complex as our own, which they are living despite our personal lack of awareness of it. I find it interesting because it’s all too obvious but also quite a discovery in itself. People are not NPCs in our lives. Who knew, right?
