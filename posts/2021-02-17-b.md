This has been on my watch later list forever and I finally watched. "Creating Cash Machine" would be a better title since that phrase early in the talk kept me listening. Here are my notes:

- Create SaaS
- Aim to get 150 permanent users
- Raise prices by offering butique service (single person doing one thing really well)
- Offer service that require monthly payment (or any kind of recurring payment)
- Don’t offer anything for free, instead offer 3 month refund guaratee
- Offer annual prepaid
- Be B2B
- Offer service that adresses constant need
- Don’t offer anything that needs to function in real-time
- Make service feature complete
- Explore after market (being part of bigger ecosystem)
- In big market just offer variation of something that exists
- Pay for ads, don’t waste time on social
