Today Sven first time said his name when asked about it. Granted, he didn’t say Sven, only "En" but it’s an improvement. Until now, he referred to himself as "Ti" ("You" in Croatian) since that’s what he heard Maja and I called him most often. Maybe not the best form on our part but whatever, it was cute while lasted.
