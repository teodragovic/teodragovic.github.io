Every time I update an app, run system updates or install new drivers etc. I do it with the hope of things working better, faster and being more stable. But it seems, most of the time, they become worse. UI goes from familiar and functional to new and unfamiliar, speed decreases and new bugs appear. This is true for all my current and past devices: Windows, Android, iPhone, Macbook...

Iâ€™m now taking the approach of disabling any kind of automatic software updates. Software updates should be done manually and only when absolutely necessary for software to work. Otherwise, no positive outcome should be expected.
