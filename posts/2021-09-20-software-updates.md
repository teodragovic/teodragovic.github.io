Every time I update an app on my phone or run system updates on my PC or install new drivers etc. I do it with the hope of things working better, faster and being more stable. But it seems, most of the time, they become worse. UI goes from familiar and functional to new and unfamiliar, speed decreases and new bugs appear.

Iâ€™m now taking the approach of disabling any kind of automatic software updates. Software updates should be done manually and only when absolutely necessary for it to work. Otherwise, no positive outcome should be expected.
