[Offical site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) lists 6 steps installation guide that was needed when WSL 1 was default version. I don’t think it’s needed anymore.

1. Go to Windows Features and enable Windows Subsystems for Lixus and Virtual Machine Platform.
2. Set WSL 2 as default version.
3. Download Ubuntu from Windows Store.
