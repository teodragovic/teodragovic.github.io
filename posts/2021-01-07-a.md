In JavaScript I often replace this:

```js
if (simpleStatement) {
    doAThing();
}
```

with this:

```js
simpleStatement && doAThing();
```

What the second example does is take advantage of [short-circuit evaluation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND#short-circuit_evaluation). If `simpleStatement` is truthy it will execute `doAThing` function, if it's falsy it would return `false` and proceed to the next line in code.

Using `if` conditional is probably easier to follow for a bigger number of people and there is rarely ever the need to choose code-golfing/simple/slick syntax over the most basic one but this one I love too much to let go.

I don't use this synatx when `simpleStatement` is not a simple truthy/falsy evaluation but instead includes equality (`===`) or multiple chained statements. When `if` block would contain more than a single line function call or when there is a need for `if else` statement I would also opt-out from this approach.
