I remember visiting [In Pieces](http://species-in-pieces.com/) the first time it was released back in 2015. and thinking it was the best, most wonderful website I’ve seen that year. In 2021. it’s still equally impressive.

For further exploration, there is great [making of article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/06/the-making-of-in-pieces/) and [Brian](http://www.brybry.co/) even made whole project [open source](https://github.com/bryanjamesinteractive/in-pieces).
