Folder can be dragged or selected to become part of open workspace. Problem is when moving workspace settings file, VS Code loses track of that folder. To fix it, go to command palette (<kbd>CTRL<kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT<kbd> + <kbd>P<kbd>) -> workspace settings -> adjust folder path from relative to absolute. Do this every time you add folder to the workspace.

Note: On Windows escape forward slash (`\\`) or convert to backslash (`/`).
