Palac made two awesome songs and then decided to quit on music. Shame. [Crveni Marlboro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vrx6rbgtH0s) is a bigger hit but I like Suze od Blanta more. Especially with accompanying video.

To be clear, his lyrics are utter nonsense and bullshit but the voice, flow and melodies are catchy as fuck.
