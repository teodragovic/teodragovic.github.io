These are the two best songs on the Roc Marciano Warm Hennery EP:

Both remixes and both done by J-Force (or J. Force). At first, that name was not familiar. Turns out, I was already following him on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/j-force718), liked his songs and read [Unkut interview](https://www.unkut.com/2012/11/j-force-the-unkut-interview/) but forgot about it.

This guy was making beats since the ’80s. He had a couple of solo singles and was part of Marley Marl’s Future Flava radio show. Funny how he stayed low-key since the ’90s and then suddenly appeared on this little compilation EP with two killer beats.
