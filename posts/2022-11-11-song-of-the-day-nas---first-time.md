Out of all Nas and Hit-Boy albums, I like Magic best. But this is my favorite song from the duo. The beat just grabbed me and made me wanna write some shit. And it’s so perfectly nostalgic without being corny or sad. It’s a celebration of that little moment every music fan experienced at some point.

Also, KD3 is (so far) the best in King’s Disease series. Super solid all the way through.
