I LOVE this type of single-purposed, focused and functional little websites. Similar to [Ian’s shoelace site](/blog/shoelace-knots/). Design is cute. Looks like someone had fun without sacrificing any accessibility. If you’re into paper planes, the content is super useful and presented in easy to digest manner.
