Another dud from my literary classics list. I didn’t like all the fluff in Fitzgerald’s writing and failed to see any greatness in it. Skimming [movie adaptation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343092/) didn’t help either.

Reads like a sad fairy tale. The plot is shallow and all characters feel underdeveloped and cartoonish. The last chapter had some redeeming qualities but came too little too late.
