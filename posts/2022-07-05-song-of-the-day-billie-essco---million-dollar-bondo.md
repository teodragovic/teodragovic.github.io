Heard it on [Take It Personal](https://www.takeitpersonalradio.com/) and immediately went to check for the artist.

It’s off his [Where in the World is Billie Essco](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mtzSwfmdAvghr7QgEGVDJ3qgvK-KXxGu8) album. Has some nice drumless beats on that project. Billie reminds me of Boldy James and Jay Electronica at times. He’s from Buffalo and Griselda affiliated but has his own sound and aesthetics.
