> The `--no-optional` argument will prevent optional dependencies from being installed.

I found this helpful while running `npm install` on a project and getting `node-gyp` error from somewhere deep in a dependency tree. Since, even with the error, everything worked fine, `node-gyp` wasnâ€™t a critical dependency. Adding `--no-optional` made the ugly error disappear (yay).
