This is the thing where you build an app for organizations (or companies or teams or projects or institutions or whatever) and then users are assigned to the organization.

From there, you have following questions:
- Can data be shared between organizations?
- Is data model the same for each organization?
- Can single user be a memeber of multiple organizations?

All important things to consider when thinking about database design, modeling and access control.
