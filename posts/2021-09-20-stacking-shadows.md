TL;DR is that stacking multiple shadows using `box-shadow` property produces more realistic, natural shadow. This is something I first learned reading [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/).

[Josh](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/designing-shadows/) also has a good article worth reading.
