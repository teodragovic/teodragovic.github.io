I never played LOL and don’t know anything about their lore but this series was super fun. Graphics and animation are beautiful. Everything looks like a big video game cut scene. Reminded me of Street Fighter V. Story did a great job of balancing all the various characters and their origin stories. There was depth in their interactions that I rarely saw in video games. The city of Piltover (and Zaun) felt dense and full of details that kept me immersed with just enough hints about the bigger world outside the city.

While I’m not itching to start playing League of Legends I can’t wait for the new season (or another spin-off) of Arcane.
