TL;DR: Use <kbd>Fn+Win</kbd> or <kbd>Fn+F6</kbd>.

I accidentally turned off the Windows key on my keyboard last week. At first, I thought my keyboard had broken down. That would be a bummer since a lot of [my favorite shortcuts](/blog/my-most-used-windows-shortcuts/) depend on it. After some debugging and googling, I found the combination above. Although <kbd>Fn+F6</kbd> doesnâ€™t do anything for me, just the <kbd>Fn+Win</kbd> one.
