This one I eat when too lazy for anything else but donâ€™t wanna junk. Psillium can be added for fiber but I never do.

**Ingredients**

- 250g cheese (Milbona)
- Whey (chocolate flavor)

**Directions**

Mix cheese and whey together until even mixture. Add water if necessary to make it creamy. Add liquid sweetener if cheese is too sour.
