Bought [Alex drawer](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/alex-drawer-unit-white-00473546/) from Ikea.

Putting it together was easier than I thought. Took me about 45 minutes. The gutter space between drawers is not perfect but it still looks nice. Lots of space for storage (which is what I needed duh).

I somehow imagined it would be shorter but it’s actually made so it can be combined with my Linnmon desk. It can fit below the desk, replacing legs on one side but I won’t be doing that.

Next step: remove the bookshelf so the drawer can sit adjacent to the desk.
