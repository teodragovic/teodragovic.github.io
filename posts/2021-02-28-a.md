Awesome series by [VinRican](https://www.instagram.com/vinrican/). Short little mixes featuring classic albums and the greatest hits from hip-hop legends mashed up with original samples they used. Blends are always nice and enjoyable, perfect to make you wanna revisit the album in full.

Hearing the original song and the way it’s sometimes flipped can be wild. Some producers just don’t mess around.

I like that mixes are never straightforward. It doesn’t always go the same sample-song-same-song sequence. And the camera angle above the turntables is a nice touch.
