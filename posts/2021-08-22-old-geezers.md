Much fun, I really enjoyed it. Has traces of Asterix, Gaston and [Ordinary Victories](https://www.amazon.com/Ordinary-Victories-Manu-Larcenet/dp/1561634239). The drawing initially reminded me of Disneyâ€™s One Hundred and One Dalmatians. Gags are great, drawing and coloring are beautiful. Nice balance between humor, social commentary and relationship drama.
