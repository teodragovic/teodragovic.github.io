After seeing [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94yh1GIwiko), I checked Lord of the Rings DVD/BluRay appendices and bonus content. Funny how I watched the original trilogy countless times (directorâ€™s cut clearly) but never explored these before. Full playlist is here:

My favorite is a documentary on [Weta Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XjoyptwUX4). The amount of craftmanship that went into making these movies is remarkable. LOTR was already my favorite trilogy of all time but now I hold it in even higher regard.
