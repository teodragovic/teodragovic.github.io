Very enjoyable. Movies and other adaptations gave me enough backstory and imagery that I could immerse in the story easily. The book is fast-paced but it gives so much more detail than a movie would.

I can see this becoming a one-off adaptation similar to Rogue One. Or at least an animated full-length. Vader/Palpatine conversations are a tad on the nose. The ending is pretty brutal. Fight scenes are most boring while I found the second half with multiple characters/teams racing to the same destination most exciting.

If Star Wars factor was removed, I would say this is a nice piece of pulp fiction. Perfect beach literature.
