**Ingredients**

- eggs
- salt
- pepper
- chives

**Optional**

- coconut oil
- bacon
- mushrooms
- cheese

**The gist**

Break and mix eggs in the pot, not a pan. Put the pot on the fire and constantly stir. Also, move it from fire from time to time and let the heat from the pot cook the eggs. Donâ€™t stop stirring and when eggs are all creamy quickly put them on the plate. Add spices (always after cooking, not during).
