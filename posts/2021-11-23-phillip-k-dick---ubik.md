Confusing and disorienting. Not sure know what to make of it. I didn’t exactly like it.

Not a fan of overloading text with imaginary words describing objects that don’t exist just for the sake of it.

Felt more bizarre and trippy than futuristic. Reminded me too much of Jodorowsky (or probably, Jodorowsky takes it a lot after Dick).

I even went to read a few reviews afterward, hoping someone else would make sense of it for me. Looked like open interpretation is a plus for most people but little insight except universal acclaim.

If anything left me puzzled enough to think about it for a minute but not overall satisfied.
