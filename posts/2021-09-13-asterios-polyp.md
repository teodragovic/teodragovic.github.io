Another re-read after a long time. And a good one. I remember liking it the first time as well. But in contrast to [Inkal](/blog/jodorowsky-and-moebius-incal/), this aged very well for me.

The culmination was kinda let down. It’s a very dense book for the majority of it and then comes no text re-imagining of Orpheus story that should represent some profound realization while the main character is in a coma (or dreaming). That just didn’t land so good with me. After that point, the book just kinda wraps up a bit too tidy and simple.

But otherwise, the visual metaphors, pacing and all the little details in the drawings make it truly superb and worth revisiting.
