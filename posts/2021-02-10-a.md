My `bashrc` contains [small function](https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/cygwin/2001-06/msg00537.html) that asks for my SSH password and keeps it while I’m logged so I don’t have to re-type it every time I make a GitHub command. Sometimes my terminal fails while or before I get to enter my password.

Now, when that happens I can run `. ~/.bashrc; start_agent`. Calling just `. ~/.bashrc` would run the whole file but there is a conditional in there that I don’t understand fully but it prevents `start_agent` function from running so I’m calling it explicitly.
