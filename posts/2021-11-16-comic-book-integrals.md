![Integral edition of Manu Larcenet Blast by Fibra](/img/fibra-blast.jpg)

This is the second Manu Larcent comic I own along with equally amazing [Ordinary Victories](https://www.fibra.hr/katalog/edicije/svagdanja-borba/6/).

With Ordinary Victories, I have two tomes and wish to have integral. With Blast, I would rather have 4 tomes (preferably with a nice hard case like the Sin City series) over integral. It’s a giant book at around 800 pages and weighing over 3kg. While the physical size of the book might add to the weight of the story itself and especially its main character, the reading experience isn’t the most optimal.

I would say ~1.5kg of weight should be the maximum for a book. Everything above I would rather have split into volumes.
