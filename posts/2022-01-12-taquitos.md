## Directions

1. Cut toritillas into quaters so you get 32 slices
2. Cut chicken into strips so it can fit into tortilla slice
3. Add very liberal amount of seasoning mix, salt and oil to the meat and let it marinade at least an hour (ideally over night)
4. Roll meat into tortillas and use tootpick so it stays in place
5. Cover bottom of the pan with oil so it would cover half of taquitos
6. Fry on high heat for a few minutes on each side (until golden brown)
7. Remove toothpicks and serve with white and red dip

**White dip**

Mix cheese spread and sour cream together. Add seasonings per taste.
