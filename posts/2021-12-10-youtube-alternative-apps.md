[NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/)
[YouTube Vanced](https://vancedapp.com/)

Both apps are add-free, allow playing music in the background (and picture-in-picture mode). I like how easily I can control sound and screen brightness in NewPipe and I can use it to watch stuff attached from my Google account (and suggestions). I use it to put on cartoons for Sven. Itâ€™s also more buggy of the two. Vanced is pretty much a YouTube app on steroids and I use it as a default app for opening YT links.

Update: Seems like [Vanced is no more](https://twitter.com/YTVanced/status/1503052250268286980). Too bad. From what I understand, they stopped actived development but current app still has few years of use left.
